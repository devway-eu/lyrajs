## Enforcement Examples

### Example 1: Constructive Disagreement ✅

**Why it's good:** Respectful, specific, provides evidence, invites discussion

### Example 2: Unhelpful Criticism ❌

**Scenario:** Reviewing a beginner's pull request

**Bad Response:**
> "This code is terrible. Did you even read the docs? Any experienced developer would know this is wrong."

**Better Response:**
> "Thanks for the PR! A few suggestions: 1) Consider using async/await instead of callbacks for better readability. Here's an example: [link]. 2) Our style guide prefers [X] over [Y]. Let me know if you need help!"

### Example 3: Handling Frustration ✅

**Scenario:** Frustrated with a bug after hours of debugging
